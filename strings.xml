    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Fatin.
    \n\nI love to do Taekwondo since secondary school.
    \n\nTaekwondo is a Korean form of martial arts, characterized by punching and kicking techniques, with emphasis on head-height kicks, jumping spinning kicks, and fast kicking techniques.
    \nFun fact is that my little sister and little brother also do Taekwondo and they already got their black belts.
    \n\nI like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, too. Muay Thai. Judo. Aikido. Mixed martial arts - not so much.
    \nAnd sometimes I want to learn and do all of them when I got free time.
    \nAnd even sometimes, I actually take part in the Taekwondo competition for open category.
    \n\nOnce, I was forced to stop Taekwondo temporarily because my SPM was around the corner and I was quite gloomy.
    \n\nI\hope I can come back stronger and will be able to get my black belt.
    \nYou should ask someone else about Taekwondo, though.\n\n</string>
